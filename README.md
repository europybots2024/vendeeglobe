# EuroPython 2024 video game tournament

## What is the tournament about?

We have created a video game that is designed to be played by a small python program, rather than a human.
Conference attendees can participate in a tournament where they (either alone or in a team) each submit a bot that will play the game, and at the end of the conference, we will have a tournament session where everyone can come and watch our strange creations play against each other (either brilliantly or it may all go wrong!).

## How to participate?

- Create a repository for your bot from [the template](https://github.com/new?owner=europybots2024&template_name=template_bot&template_owner=europybots2024).
- Register your team: fill in the form at https://forms.gle/TosuLTY1zo59FNSz5 (no limit on the number of participants)
- Read the game rules below and start working on your bot
- Ask questions on the Discord forum `pybot-game-tournament`
- Once your bot is ready, make sure you copy it into the `main` branch of the repo you created
- Deadline is 15:00 on Friday July 12th
- Tournament will be 15:30 - 16:45 on Friday July 12th in the Open Space area

## TL;DR

1. Create a repository for your bot from [the template](https://github.com/new?owner=europybots2024&template_name=template_bot&template_owner=europybots2024).
