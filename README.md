# EuroPython 2024 video game tournament

## What is the tournament about?

We have created a video game that is designed to be played by a small python program, rather than a human.
Conference attendees can participate in a tournament where they (either alone or in a team) each submit a bot that will play the game, and at the end of the conference, we will have a tournament session where everyone can come and watch our strange creations play against each other (either brilliantly or it may all go wrong!).

## How to participate?

- Create a repository for your bot from [the template](https://github.com/new?owner=europybots2024&template_name=template_bot&template_owner=europybots2024).
- Register your team: fill in the form at https://forms.gle/TosuLTY1zo59FNSz5 (no limit on the number of participants)
- Read the game rules below and start working on your bot
- Ask questions on the Discord forum `pybot-game-tournament`
- Once your bot is ready, make sure you copy it into the `main` branch of the repo you created
- Deadline is 15:00 on Friday July 12th
- Tournament will be 15:30 - 16:45 on Friday July 12th in the Open Space area

## TL;DR

1. Create a repository for your bot from [the template](https://github.com/new?owner=europybots2024&template_name=template_bot&template_owner=europybots2024).

2. Get started with:

```
conda create -n <NAME> -c conda-forge python=3.10.*
conda activate <NAME>
git clone https://github.com/europybots2024/vendeeglobe.git
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<MYBOTNAME>.git
cd vendeeglobe/
python -m pip install -e .
cd run/
ln -s ../../<MYBOTNAME> .
python play.py
```

## The game: Vendeeglobe

Around the world sailing race

Preview

![Preview](https://github.com/europybots2024/vendeeglobe/assets/39047984/1ed0ec51-4d42-40de-bed6-88eefebab866)


## Goal & general rules

- Sail around the world as fast as possible
- Start from les Sables-dâ€™Olonne in France
- There are two mandatory checkpoints
- Each round has a time limit of 8 minutes (=80 days)

## Mandatory checkpoints

- A checkpoint is a location on the globe (latitude+longitude) with a radius
- If you sail within the checkpoint radius, the checkpoint has been reached
- The first mandatory checkpoint is located in the middle of the pacific ocean and has a radius of 2000 km
- The second mandatory checkpoint is located in the middle of the indian ocean and has a radius of 1200 km

## Weather

- Only the wind is a factor (there are no ocean currents)
- Wind is randomly generated for every game, and stays static for 12 hours during a round

## Sailing

- The angle between ship and wind affects ship speed

- With a wind force of 1, the ship will go as fast as the wind
- Ships will get stuck when reaching land (obviously!), but will not crash: you can turn around
- Ships cannot crash into each other (they behave like ghosts)

## Scoring

- Points from 1st to last place decay exponentially (and depend on the number of players)

- Back home with 2 checkpoints is best (or closest to home)
- Then closest to 2nd checkpoint, then closest to 1st checkpoint

## Timing

Here is a table that gives the correspondance between real/user time duration and the amount of time that goes by in the game.

| Real/User time | Time in game |
| --- | --- |
| 8 mins   | 80 days  |
| 1 min    | 10 days  |
| 6 sec    |  1 day   |
| 1 sec    |  4 hours |
| 0.25 sec |  1 hour  |

## The control center - the Bot

- To play the game, you will have to create a Python program.
- It should contain a class named `Bot` and that class should have a method named `run`.
- Every time step, the `run` method will be called, and it will be inside that function that you should control your ship.
- You are provided with a `bot.py` in the `template_bot` repository to give you an example.

Look at the comments in `bot.py` for details on what information is available to you at every time step and how to control your vessel.

## The weather forecast

- The `weather_forecast` is one of the arguments the `run` function will receive.
- It represents wind data for the 5 days to come (for the entire globe).
- The accuracy of the forecast decreases the further in time you look: the figure below shows the same weather data (value of the horizontal `u` wind component) 1 day in the future, and 5 days in the future

- It is a `WeatherForecast` class which has a method to get the wind horizontal (`u`) and vertical (`v`) vector components for any given location(s) in space (latitude and longitude) and time (from 0 to 5 days).
```Py
u, v = forecast.get_uv(latitudes, longitudes, times)
```

## The world map

- The `world_map` is another of the arguments received by your bot's `run` function.
- It is a `MapProxy` class (not the actual map data used by the game to prevent bots from writing their own map!).
- It has a method `get_data` to get the world map values (1 = sea, 0 = land) for any given latitude(s) and longitude(s):
```Py
map_values = world_map.get_data(latitudes, longitudes)
```

## Instructions for the ship

The bot will control the ship by returning a set of instructions that will then be read and applied by the game engine.
You initialize a `Instructions` object, and then set one of the following:

- `Location`: a latitude/longitude to go to (using the shortest straight-line path on the surface of the globe, ignoring land mass)
- `Heading`:	heading for the ship in degrees (East is 0, North is 90, West is 180, South is 270)
- `Vector`: vector for the ship (instead of heading)
- `Left`:	turn left X degrees
- `Right`:	turn right X degrees

### Ship speed

Additionally, you can control the ship's speed by choosing how much `sail` to deploy: a number between 0 and 1
